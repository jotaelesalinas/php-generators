/*
 * Crude attempt to mimic the IteratorAggregate interface.
 * 
 * The idea behind this is that, when you call $obj->send() on a GeneratorAggregate implementation,
 * PHP automatically calls $obj->getGenerator(), gets the generator and calls send() on it,
 * like it does when iterating on an object implementing IteratorAggregate.
 * 
 * A possible hack to get it is create a send() function that calls getGenerator() only the first time,
 * storing its returned value in a static variable. Second and subsequent calls use the static variable
 * instead of calling getGenerator() again. See trait GeneratorAggregateHack.
